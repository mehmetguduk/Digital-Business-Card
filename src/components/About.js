                As someone who grew up with computer technology, any work in relation to computers is a massive passion for me. I discovered my interest in design when I installed Adobe Photoshop CS6 on my computer a long time ago. Working on photos for hours with some chill background music was utterly joyful. Later, I continued this interest by making vector drawings with Adobe Photoshop Illustrator. Then realized that I can turn this into web development.
